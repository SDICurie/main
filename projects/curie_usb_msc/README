Overview:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
curie_hello project has the following functionality implemented using xloop:
--Printing Hello ARC and Quark and Watchdog Keepalive is implemented using the xloop_post_func_periodic.
--GPIO embedded LED blinks whose frequency depends on ADC value.

It implements a standard usage of the framework.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Read the ADC Value
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***********Put a flying wire between the AD0(J14) to 3.3V(J10)or GND (J10)************

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected behavior
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The frequency of the LED blink depends on the ADC read value:
AD0 is connected to GND: ADC value is greater than 0 and less than 700, LED blinks for every 1 sec.
AD0 is connected to 3.3V:If the ADC value is greater than 3800, LED blinks for every 500ms.
AD0 is floating:If the ADC value is in between 700 and 3800,LED blinks for every 2 sec.

On the Console, Hello QUARK, Hello ARC and adc_value are printed out

How to Compile the Hello project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project is built 'out of tree'. First a build folder needs to be created (anywhere in the file-system).
Better not to create this folder inside source tree.

	mkdir out
	cd out
	make -f PATH_TO/wearable_device_sw/projects/curie_hello/Makefile setup
	make package

This produces a ZIP file that will be used for flashing the board. By default,
this file is located under "pub" in the OUT folder created above:

	PATH_TO_OUT_FOLDER/pub/device/curie_hello/image/curie_101/release/

The default location can be overwritten by specifying the desired PUB path to
the "make package" command:

	make package PUB="/path/to/your/pub/folder"
