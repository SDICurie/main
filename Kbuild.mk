# This file is the root of the build tree for each project
#
# The order of declarations of subdirectories is VERY important,
# as it defines which level has precedence for:
# - the include path search order (for header overrides),
# - the object link order (for weak function overrides).
#
# The current order is:
# - project,
# - core,
# - board,
# - soc.
