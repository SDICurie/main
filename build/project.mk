#
# PROJECT      : the project name
# BOARD        : a board name, for which a $(BOARD).mk must be available

# basic commands (setup, help, ...).

# When running the special setup command, a new Makefile is created in the
# output directory. This Makefile gives access to the specific build commands
# for the specified board (image, package, ...).
